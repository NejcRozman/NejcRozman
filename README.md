# Hi, I'm Nejc 👋  
### Researcher in Advanced Technologies • Blockchain × Robotics • AI Agents • Emerging Tech Innovator

I am a university researcher exploring the intersection of **blockchain systems**, **machine economy**, **AI agents**, and **autonomous robotics**. My work focuses on how intelligent machines and decentralized technologies can coordinate, interact, and operate autonomously.

Alongside research, I explore **innovation in emerging technologies** and work on early-stage ideas that bridge academic prototypes with real-world entrepreneurial impact.
